Date: 2020-05-28
  Features:
    - Fixed Gizmo's Car Keys interface, so that it will actually work once Pi-C updates.

    - Added migration step to convert double winches to single winches (only when upgrading from 1.2.x).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that these vehicle flags would not be saved and restored: minable, destructible, operable, rotatable, enable_logistics_while_moving.
    - Fixed that any mod changes would reset Vehicle Wagon tutorial states.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.18.4
Date: 2020-05-24
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed missing dependency on Krastorio2 by moving modded wagons to data-updates. No more dependencies!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.18.3
Date: 2020-05-23

    - Added new scaled sprites for Schall Light Tank and Schall Heavy Tank, with matching wagon weights.
    - Added startup settings to adjust braking and friction force of vehicle wagons.
    - Added startup setting to control maximum weight of load-able vehicles.
    - Added compability with Krastorio 2 Advanced Tank (beta graphics), if you change the Maximum Weight to more than 150000.
    - Added alt-mode icons showing what vehicle is loaded in each wagon.
    - Added custom boolean parameter "vehicle_loaded" to "script_raised_destroy" event when vehicle was loaded successfully.

    - Uploaded by robot256
  Changes:
    - Rebalanced wagon weights and stats so that vehicle weight is treated fairly. Hauling tanks needs multiple locomotives now.
    - Fixed compatibility with Train Overhaul so wagon speed is set to match the Nuclear Locomotive.
    - Updated German locale with the many new strings, thanks to ST-DDT and Pi-C (Work in Progress).
    - Improved locale structure with cross-referencing.
    - Improved behavior when players move or get in vehicles mid-loading.
    - Changed selection indicator to an area highlight instead of giant arrows.
    - Changed unloading zone to oblong shape surrounding wagon.
    - Changed unloading behavior so that vehicles always point outwards, driving off the ramp.
    - Improved loading ramp graphics.

    - Moved final weight calculations to data-final-fixes so that they are consistent with the final wagon and vehicle weights set by other mods.
    - Added mininum distance based on vehicle size to avoid accidentally destroying the wago when unloading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.18.2
Date: 2020-03-02

    - Removed dependency on StdLib mod.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed compatibility with Mobile Factory mod by fixing how last_user and player_index are saved and restored.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.0
Date: 24. 1. 2020
  Changes:
    - Initial support for Factorio 0.18.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that clicking on a non-vehicle, non-vehicle-wagon entity would not unload a vehicle nearby.
    - Fixed crash when unloading at certain angles on the track.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 23. 1. 2020
  Major Features:
    - Construction robots can unload or deconstruct Loaded Wagons without losing the loaded vehicle or any of its contents.
    - Save/Restore logic updated so that vehicles and items are almost never permanently lost.
    - New graphics by YuokiTani for the Aircraft mod's Cargo Plane, Gunship, and Jet.
    - Weights of loaded and empty wagons can adjusted to represent the vehicles they contain.
  Features:
    - Items with partial ammo, durability, and health will be stored correctly.
    - Blueprints, books, and planners stored in vehicles will be stored correctly.
    - Grid-containing items stored in vehicles will be recreated without losing an equipment (but can't be reinserted into that item's grid).
    - Any items that cannot be added to the fuel or ammo of the unloaded vehicle will be added to the trunk.
    - Any items that cannot be added to the trunk will be spilled on the ground.
    - When the player mines a loaded wagon, any items from the loaded vehicle that cannot be inserted into the player's inventory will be spilled on the ground.
    - Runtime setting controls whether robots must always take vehicles back to logistic storage, or if they may try to unload the vehicle.
      (The robot might put the vehicle on nearby train tracks, and your car will get run over by a train!)
    - Startup settings to enable custom wagon weight calculations:
      Empty Wagon Weight Factor sets the empty Vehicle Wagon weight as a fraction of the standard cargo wagon.  Flatbeds weight less than boxcars, so this is typically less than 1.
      Vehicle Weight Factor sets the weight added to Loaded Vehicle Wagons as a fraction of the primary vehicle type for that Loaded Wagon sprite.  Vehicle weights are scaled differently than train weights, so this is typically less than 0.5.
  Ease of Use:
    - Players can load and unload multiple wagons simultaneously.
    - Only one winch item is needed to operate the Vehicle Wagons, and it never leaves the cursor.
    - Laser beam indicates in-progress loading and unloading actions.
    - Improved status and error messages.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that you had to click the winch on the center of a vehicle or wagon, not just in the selection box.
    - Fixed that wagons would get recoupled incorrectly when loading/unloading.
    - Fixed crash when unloading a vehicle, or vehicle with contents from, an uninstalled mod.
    - Fixed that only one player could load/unload on exactly the same tick.
    - Fixed that robots mining a loaded wagon would cause the loss of the loaded vehicle.
    - Fixed that global data table was polluted when a loaded wagon was died without unloading.
    - Fixed crash when vehicle or wagon was mined or destroyed during loading operation.
    - Fixed crash when attempting to unload a wagon whose stored vehicle data is missing.
    - Fixed that sometimes winch would not be returned to player.
    - Fixed that using the "undo" tool after deconstructing a loaded wagon would produce an un-buildable loaded-wagon ghost.
    - Fixed crash/glitchy behavior when unloading a vehicle whose currently_burning fuel item was uninstalled or modified.
  Changes:
    - Internal data structure has been redesigned for better maintainability and to hold all this new information.
      Existing data will be migrated to the new structure.
      Do not downgrade from VehicleWagon2 version 2.x to any 1.x version.
    - Added dependency on StdLib mod, removed stdlib source from this mod.
  Info:
    - This release contains a nearly total rewrite of the Vehicle Wagon scripts by robot256.
    - Many thanks to YuokiTani for providing new graphics for the loaded aircraft!
